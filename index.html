    <h3>What is Cyber Crime?</h3>

    <p>
        
        Cyber crime refers to any illegal activity that is carried out using computers, digital devices, or the internet. In cyber crime, technology is either the target of the crime (such as hacking a system) or the tool used to commit the crime (such as online fraud).

With the rapid growth of the internet, cyber crimes have increased significantly around the world. Criminals use advanced techniques to steal personal data, money, and sensitive information from individuals, businesses, and even governments.

Cyber crime can affect anyone who uses digital devices, including students, professionals, and organizations.
